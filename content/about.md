![that's me!](/images/about/cara.jpg "that's me!")

I'm an MS in Computer Science student at Stanford. Here, I'm specializing in the Artificial Intelligence track.

Before this, I was a machine learning engineer at Wayfair, where I worked on various visual similarity and exact product matching projects.

I graduated from Dartmouth College, where I studied Computer Science and Cognitive Science. My [thesis](/pdfs/about/thesis.pdf) compared representations learned by various CNN architectures to those of the human ventral visual pathway.

Check out my [resume](/pdfs/about/resume.pdf).
