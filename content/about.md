I'm an MS in Computer Science student at Stanford. Here, I'm specializing in the Artificial Intelligence track. In the [Stanford Machine Learning Group](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/) and [Shah Lab](https://shahlab.stanford.edu/), I'm researching applications of representation learning and few-shot learning using patient images (X-ray and CT) and text (electronic health record).

Before this, I was a machine learning engineer at Wayfair, where I worked on various visual similarity and exact product matching projects.

I graduated from Dartmouth College, where I studied Computer Science and Cognitive Science. My [thesis](/pdfs/about/thesis.pdf) compared representations learned by various CNN architectures to those of the human ventral visual pathway.
